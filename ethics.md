# Our ethical beliefs
v0.1 - Released December 1, 2024

## Responsible use of artificial intellgience

We believe in a future where all AI is _responsbile_ AI.

We will never build an AI system that undermines data privacy or produces outputs that are harmful or discrimantory.

## Nonpartisanship

We (Andrew and Joao) have our own personal political beliefs. But as an organization (Verita Research), we aim to be nonpartisan, impartial, and unbiased about the information we release.

## We are not the arbiters of truth

We do not decide what is true or not. Nor do we care where the truth comes from.

We believe in processes for arriving at truth, like peer-review and the scientific method.

## The criticality of human oversight

AI is a tool, not a replacement for human judgment. Any and all information that we can human review, we do.

## Transparency about our mistakes

We do not claim to be perfect.

We promise to always be transparent about the errors we commit and the mistakes we make, especially in the event we accidentally disseminate misinformation of our own.
